// const User = require('./user');
// const Picture = require('./picture');
// const Reward = require('./reward');
// const EcoAct = require('./ecoAct');

// module.exports = {
//   User,
//   Picture,
//   Reward,
//   EcoAct
// };


//With this index.js file in place, you can now import multiple models at once in your controller files or other parts of your application

/*
const { User, Picture, Reward, EcoAct } = require('../models');


This syntax allows you to import all the models using a single line of code, 
which makes it easier to manage your imports, 
especially if you have many models in your application.
